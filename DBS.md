## Distributed Generation

Distributed generation using renewable sources is gaining popularity due to environmental concerns over burning fossil fuels, deregulation of the electricity industry, and echnological advances in power electronics and renewable energy systems.
Distributed renewable sources can be harnessed by using power-electronic converters to link them directly with the existing power system, or by combining them with local loads to form an independent power system . A nanogrid falls into this category. In this paper, the term nanogrid is used to describe a hybrid power system that supplies a cluster of loads with a peak rating in the order of 2â€“20 kW, since small-scale renewable generation tends to be more expensive than conventional forms of generation, nanogrids are mainly suited for niche applications such as power supplies for remote isolated locations. Constructing a standalone system to supply a cluster of remote loads is often cheaper than connecting the remote loads to the conventional ac system.
The building blocks of the nanogrid are powerelectronic interface converters.
Step-up converters allow low voltage sources to discharge into the nanogrid, and step-down converters allow the loads to draw power from the nanogrid.
A bidirectional converter allows the storage node to charge from and discharge into the nanogrid.
The nanogrid operates at dc since dc offers advantages such as improved transmission efficiency and ease of interfacing asynchronous sources such as wind turbines to the system. In standalone hybrid renewable systems, uncontrollable renewable sources supply the average load demand, while storage acts as an energy buffer, balancing short-term differences between the source and load powers. Nonrenewable generation is included to improve system reliability in the event of a longterm shortage of renewable energy. To maximize the use of the renewable sources, the system must be controlled in an optimal fashion according to a system control law. The conventional means of achieving this objective is to use a central controller that is aware of each component in the system. However, the reliability of the system is degraded as a practical implementation of this control strategy creates dependence on a central controller and communication link. To improve the system reliability while allowing the implementation of a control law, a distributed control strategy is preferred, as the system becomes independent of the central controller. DC-bus signaling (DBS) is a means of controlling a hybrid renewable system in a distributed fashion.
This control strategy maintains the reliability inherent in the structure of the system by using the dc bus itself as the communication link.

## DBS
- DC Bus Signalling

DBS is an extension of the concept of using charge/discharge thresholds to schedule individual sources in a distributed fashion. Scheduling of the sources is achieved by making the operation of the source/storage interface converters dependent on the level of the dc bus in relation to their charge/discharge threshold; however, voltage droop is included to allow multiple converters to operate at each threshold. Voltage-level changes on the dc bus, which occur as changes in the system, force these converters to switch between constant voltage and constant power operation. These voltage-level changes on the dc bus are used by the source and storage interface converters to determine their mode of operation.
